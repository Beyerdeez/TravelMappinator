This little program is a demo for something bigger I plan to make for university.

It's a traveling planner and you are supposed to just see if you can fit your dream vacation into your tight-fisted budget of choice.

Implementation is currently non-existent, but all of the key methods seem to be figured out.

TO DO:
- [ ] use text file as database (easily expandable n whatnot)
- [ ] implement a check that checks if countries are adjacent (so you can just skip a country you're forced to take a stop there)
- [ ] maybe add a GUI cuz i feel like it
- [ ] actually make the program.
